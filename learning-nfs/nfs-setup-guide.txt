nfs - network file system
    used to share files over network of one system (system A) to another (system B )over same network

nfs server :
    1. required packages
    2. configuration file
            /etc/exports 
    3. services 
            a. nfs 
            b. nfs lock 
            c. portmap

now to start with nfs :
    create a new directory in System A 
        mkdir /projects
        cd /projects 
        cat > samplecode
            skdhfkshd   lsdjfjsjd   sldjfksjdl

    now this file we have to access from System B

    to find nfs is installed or not 
        rpm -qa  nfs*

    mount some directory    
        mount /dev/hdc /media/
        cd /media/Server 

    packages to be installed 
        nfs-utils
        nfs-utils-lib
        nfs-utils-lib-devel

    after installing the required packages we have to look for the configuration files
        vim /etc/exports

        by default empty file will be there
        enter whatever directory you want to share 
            /project    * (rw,sync)
        
    now start the services 
        sudo service nfs start 
        sudo service nfslock start
        sudo service portmap start 

    on System B we can see the mount by 
        showmount -e "ip address of the server "
        mkdir /nfs
        mount "ip address of server":/project /nfs 
        cd /nfs 
        ls 
            and you ll be able to see all the files here
